# React Simple QR Scanner
A simple React wrapper around browser native BarcodeDetector API.  
Support is really not good at the moment  ([caniuse](https://caniuse.com/mdn-api_barcodedetector)), but enough for my use case.  
If I have the time I may try to use the canvas method to have a fallback when BarcodeDetector is not available


## Setup
```
npm i @fabiendeborde/react-simple-qr-scanner
```

```
yarn add  @fabiendeborde/react-simple-qr-scanner
```
